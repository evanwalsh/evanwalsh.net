Dustin Curtis writes about Twitter's new decision to recommend accounts by tracking your browsing history outside of Twitter.

The conversation continued outside of Twitter with a Twitter employee, which I have [archived here](http://storify.com/evanwalsh/twitter-is-tracking-you-on-the-web) for your reading pleasure.

My father and I just discussed this earlier in a roundabout discussion that started with the recent Facebook IPO. I expressed my concerns about privacy in this day and age to him. My father said he wished my generation would just "turn off" because it is all "too much". I wasn't inclined to agree with him then and I'm not saying I do now. However, technology is good and technology is bad.

How can we trust it to be used well by the corporations that we so willingly buy into with our attention and our identity? Do we continue to give ourselves away for free and hope our data is used for us and not against us? I don't know. Disconnecting is hard, but it may be the right thing for some.

Hard questions.
