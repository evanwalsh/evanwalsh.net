Progress is coming along rather well on the engine. I've got scripting access via [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/) and [Sqrat](http://scrat.sourceforge.net/). I was very proud of myself that first moment I accessed the C++ engine from a script. It's not often I feel smart, but that was one moment.

Ideas for the game's content are constantly percolating in my head. Sometimes it feels like a disservice to spend so much time wrapped up in the tech of the thing, but it's vital for this to be a success in my eyes. I want my vision to be fulfilled in a timely manner, though, so I won't spend half my life perfecting this thing. Rapid iterations!

Also, I've been wondering what's best when it comes to distributing the game's code. I want modifications to be possible, but I'd absolutely hate for someone to steal my game and make it their own. I guess I'll need to work out a license that permits mods, but not complete redistributions. That's putting the complete game cart in front of the work horse, though.

I'll have screens as soon as possible! Unfortunately, code screenshots are about as boring as it gets, so nothing for now. Stay tuned, true believers.
