I wasn't able to work much on TLE this week, but I did do some fun stuff. I added random building outlines, random name generation, and creepy NPCs.

##Buildings?

I need to look into more procedural generation techniques, but I've got some basic random building size generation. It takes the base tilesize (and maximum dimensions) and spits out a random building size that I'm currently drawing as a grey box. Fun!

##Random names?

NPCs (or Actors, as I refer to them in the game) will be randomly generated. Thus, they need a random name. I've been building up a big ol' file of first and last names that I like. I need to do more work to make it more random and to have less collisions.

##Creepy NPCs?

They look at you as you walk around. Why? Because of reasons.
