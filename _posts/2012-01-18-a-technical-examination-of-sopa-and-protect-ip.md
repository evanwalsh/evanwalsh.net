A long read, as the kids call it, but worth it.

If you can't be bothered, here's the conclusion from the analysis:

>It is my strong belief that both PROTECT IP and SOPA:
>
>  * Will not stop the piracy they are targeting
>  * Contain language that is highly ambiguous and extremely broad making them ripe for abuse, and
>  * Introduce regulation and enforce censorship on what should be a free and open internet.
