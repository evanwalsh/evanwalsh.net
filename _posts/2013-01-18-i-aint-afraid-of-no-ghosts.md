In the past, I've shied away from writing about technical matters. I do write a lot of code at my job and in my off-hours, but I never really tell anyone about what I do. I can't reveal a lot of what I work on at Harvest, but I can write about things I learn that can be abstracted.

My side projects often don't come to fruition due to distraction and lack of motivation. I've started on a project that's very important to me, though. I want to see it to completion and I will do whatever is reasonable to accomplish that. I'll post soon with some starting details.

For now, here's another Rdio playlist: [Get Hype 2: The Hype Strikes Back](http://rd.io/x/QAgcL1f9FA)
