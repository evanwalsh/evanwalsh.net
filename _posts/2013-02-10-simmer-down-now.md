I hinted at a project [in my previous post](/log/2013/1/i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghosts) that I'd start writing about and this is me starting to make good on that.

I'm making a video game.

##Oh, so original

I know I'm not the first nerdy guy to make a video game and I'm certainly not the last, but this has been a long time coming. Before I wanted to make techs on the Web, I wanted to make video games. I just didn't know enough about programming and art to even begin accomplishing that. I am much older and wiser and stronger and nerdier now.

##About this game, yeah?

Right, the game. Well, I don't want to set any expectations that I will possibly violate in the future. However, I will say it will feature strong narrative elements and potential co-operative gameplay. I'm intensely fascinated by player-created narratives in games that don't explicitly force a story. We'll see how that goes, though.

##When will I learn more about this?

I want to write a post every five days or so about this. By stating this in writing, I will undoubtedly 
not write every five days or so. That's life.

Flip you on the flipside.
