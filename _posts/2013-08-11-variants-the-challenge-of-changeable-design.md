I meant to link to this article a while ago, but better late the never, yeah? Achievements are old hat and not fun. This article by [Keith Burgun](http://keithburgun.net/) proposes "variants":

> I am considering anything that changes the game rules a "variant". So that means that Smash Brothers: No Items is a Smash Brothers variant, but Street Fighter With No Music wouldn't be. I do, in general, believe that by changing a single rule, you are in fact creating a new game. After all, as anyone who has ever tried to balance a game knows, changing just one rule will usually have ripple-effects throughout a game system, often dramatically changing its character.

For those curious, I've already implemented variants into my game in lieu of achievements.
