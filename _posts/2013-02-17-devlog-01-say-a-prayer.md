I've been oscilatting between "I CAN DO THIS" and "I WILL NEVER EVEN START DOING THIS"

Well guess what! I have made progress since I last wrote. Take that!

I've been working on the art style of the game, which shouldn't be such a problem. The main decision was "2D or 3D?" I considered the difficulty of both and what would best serve my vision. I decided upon 2D.

Now, what type of game will this be? I'LL TELL YOU, OK? GEEZ. It'll be a top-down shooter roguelike RPG. Doesn't that sound 
so totally exciting.

I'll tell you the name next week, yeah? Also, lore details! BOOM.
