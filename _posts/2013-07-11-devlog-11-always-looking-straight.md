I haven't worked on my game for a few weeks. I guess I got the point where I wasn't actually working on my game. I was working on an engine that I wasn't even totally in love with.

It's frustrating, having to throw things away. I think I'm going to do it, though. I want to make a game, not an engine. I did learn a ton about how the guts of things work, but I'm tired of figuring out how to display simple images and playing audio. I just want to make my game.

I'll update in a little bit with a new screenshot.
