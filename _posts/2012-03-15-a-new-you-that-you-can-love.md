So, any regular visitor to this site (are there any?) will notice a new design. It's a bit more of what I like, in the end. I like a lot of whitespace, but my site has, historically, been light text on a dark background.

My inspiration for this design comes from a few different sources. A long-time hero of mine, Garrett Murray, had [an awesome design a few years ago](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garrettmurray/428132308/in/set-72157594562449361) which was the first thing that sparked me to even want to redesign my blog. He has never ceased to impress me with his work, even after all these years.

Also, my favorite TextMate theme was a huge influence. The Code School theme by AstonJ, found [here](http://astonj.com/tech/rails-textmate-themes/). It's a stellar theme.

I got a new job that I start on Monday. I'll write after I've started and describe how I went from unemployed to rockstar wizard hotshot. Or whatever.
