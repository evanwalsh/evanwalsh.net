Here's the first screenshot of a Massive Engine "game". It's C++ and it's awesome. OpenGL is neither fun nor easy, but I'm getting the hang of it. I'm still fleshing out some bits of the engine, but it's nearly to the point where I can port over some of my old Lua jazz.

Oh man, I still have to do Lua bindings on top of all this. Ugh.
