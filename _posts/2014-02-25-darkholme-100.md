Here's the first open source result from my game development: an entity-component
system written in Ruby! It's called [Darkholme](https://github.com/massivedanger/darkholme)
and I am super proud of what I've done with it. It's a real open source project!

I wrote it initially to fulfull a need and to learn a bit about how games work
these days. It's heavily inspired by the work of Stefan Bachmann on [ashley](https://github.com/stbachmann/ashley),
so I'd be remiss if I didn't think him heavily. Thanks, Stefan, you're awesome!

It'll be evolving as my game evolves, but I encourage you to [try it out](https://github.com/massivedanger/darkholme#darkholme).
