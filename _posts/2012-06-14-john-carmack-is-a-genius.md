Whenever I see anything that John Carmack, co-founder of id Software, has said or written, I can only be taken aback by how much of a different level he is on. I like to think I'm decent at what I do, but his coding prowess is beyond what I can comprehend.

I was first turned on to the immense intellect of John Carmack via the book 
[Masters of Doom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812972155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evawal-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812972155). It's a stellar read and I cannot recommend it enough.

The interesting aspect of these interviews I've linked to is that he was quite visionary when it came to coming trends in the gaming industry. Also, his words on texturing techniques later became reality in id's game Rage, although that game was more of a tech demo than a fully-realised vision. In any case, John Carmack is a genius and I'll give him a pass no matter what he does. Let's just hope Doom 4 is a worthy followup.
